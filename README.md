# 🤖 Agri Vision - Agricultural Field Demarcation, Measurement, Health & Crop Classification Using Deep Learning Techniques

## 🤖 Agri Vision, a machine learning model that will be able to identify, demark and measure crop fields in the provided satellite or drone image. Additionally, the model will be able to identify the type of crop(s) present in the field and their health as well. The model is completely functional and ready to use on any real world data

### 🤖 Agri Vision - Conventional Method

This method uses Canny Edge Detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images.

### 🤖 Agri Vision - Health Checker

This model scans an image of the crop leaf and efficiently detects possible diseases effecting the crop.

### 🤖 Agri Vision - Crop Classification

This method uses GeoTiff Images (.tif) and classifies the field based on its crop type.

### 🤖 Agri Vision - Field Demarcation

Demarcates crop fields in a satellite image (.png) and calculates its area in acres.
